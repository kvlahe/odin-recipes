    <h3>HOW TO MAKE THE BEST PESTO PENNE PASTA</h3>
    <p>Learn this quick and easy recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>penne pasta - or substitute with your favourite kind of pasta. I like the penne shape because it traps so much delicious sauce inside.</li>
        <li>basil pesto - it's really easy to make fresh basil pesto homemade in just 5 minutes, or you can easily use store-bought pesto as well.</li>
        <li>cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the penne pasta. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add penne pasta and a little bit salt, and cook till al dente (fully cooked but still firm) about 8-10 minutes, or according to package directions. Do not overcook the pasta. Turn off the heat and reserve at least ¼ cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta in a colander and let it cool for 1 minute.</li><br>
      <li>Toss in pesto. Transfer pasta into a large mixing bowl and add pesto and reserved pasta water (¼ cup or more, if desired). Season with salt and pepper and toss well to coat. Stir in cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese.</li><br>
      <li>Serve. Serve immediately. Sprinkle extra parmesan on top, if desired.</li><br>
    </ol>
